For this project we are investigating some Spotify data, taken from:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/most-streamed-spotify-songs-2024?resource=download

The main focus of this EDA are the following questions:

1) Which artist has been the most popular so far in 2024?
2) Which albums have been the most popular so far in 2024?
3) What is the relationship between Spotify Playlist Count and Spotify Playlist Reach?
4) How does a song being "Explicit" affect streams?

From this, we show examples of understanding of the manipulation of data frames, pandas, graphical modelling and inferrence.
